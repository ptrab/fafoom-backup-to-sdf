= Code Snippets

Some minor code snippets that I find useful and might be helpful for others too.

== Gnuplot

.Gnuplot 5.2 input line to plot the first ten excited states from an ORCA 5.0.3 TDDFT-Scan for a multi XYZ file
[source]
--
nStates=10
gnuplot> plot for [i=0:nStates-1] "< grep 'STATE.*:' s2.out" every nStates::i using 4 with lp title sprintf("S_{%i}", i+1)
--

== VIM

.Finding all references from a text document written as [1], [1-2], [1,2-3], [1-2,3] and so on and copies them into t
[source]
--
:let t=[] | %s/\[\(\d\+\(-\d\+\)\?,\?\)\+\]/\=add(t,submatch(1))[1:0]/g
--

When the document has been searched, the contents of `t` can be printed with `:pu=t`

== Gaussian

I encountered the error `Internal consistency failure #1 in ROv06.`
This error means that there is a problem with the Overlay 6 from the IOps: https://gaussian.com/overlay6/
By looking at what is handled by overlay 6, it is clear that the error has something to do with my population analysis keyword.
